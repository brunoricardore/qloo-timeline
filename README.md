# Hello Qloo Team!
The timeline and the calendar were created sing the most JS/TS as possible, to do not support my work only on CSS features.

**Please use, Node version >=18**

To run the project:

 1. run `npm install` inside the root of the project
 2. then `npm start` to start the project on port 3000

I spent something like 8 hours working on this, the biggest challange was handling the event positioning to avoid overlays.
I did extend the events when it goes over the month, ah! also it has inline edition, just click over it to show the form.

If I have more time, I would work more in the styles, but I think just for demonstration, it is not looking that bad, also I would work on DnD and make some tests on event edition, avoiding event overlapping...

Git tell you guys, long time only using fullcalendar lib, we loose track on some things, but i manage to make most of it work.

Hope you guys enjoy my work!
